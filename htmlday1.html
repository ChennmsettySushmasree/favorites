        <h1>BEACH</h1>
        <img src="beach.jpg" height="300pxl" alt="">
        
        <p>A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a
            beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources,
            such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending
            on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of
            material.

            Though some beaches form on inland freshwater locations such as lakes and rivers, most beaches are in
            coastal areas where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments. Erosion and changing of beach
            geologies happens through natural processes, like wave action and extreme weather events. Where wind
            conditions are correct, beaches can be backed by coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for
            the beach. However, these natural forces have become more extreme due to climate change, permanently
            altering beaches at very rapid rates. Some estimates describe as much as 50 percent of the earth's sandy
            beaches disappearing by 2100 due to climate-change driven sea level rise.[2]</p>
